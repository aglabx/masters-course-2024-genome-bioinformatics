### Task 1: Converting PacBio HiFi Reads (BAM to FASTQ)

**Objective:** Obtain FASTQ files containing PacBio HiFi reads, providing the foundation for downstream analysis and assembly.

**Instructions:**

1. **Tool Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate tool for converting PacBio BAM files to FASTQ. Several options exist:
     - **bam2fastx (Pacific Biosciences):** The official tool from PacBio ([https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/bam2fastx](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/bam2fastx))
     - **samtools:** Versatile suite for manipulating sequence alignments  ([http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html))
     - **bedtools:** Flexible toolset with BAM conversion capabilities ([https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

2. **Tool Installation:**
   - Provide detailed instructions on how to install the chosen BAM-to-FASTQ conversion tool onto your system. Specify commands and operating system considerations (Linux, macOS, etc.).

3. **Conversion Process:**
   - Execute the chosen tool, providing the following essential details:
     - Command used to perform the conversion.
     - Input (PacBio HiFi BAM files).
     - Output (the desired FASTQ files).

4. **Verification:**
   - Inspect the generated FASTQ files to ensure successful conversion. You can do this by:
      - Checking file sizes.
      - Using  tools like `head` or `tail` to preview the contents of the FASTQ files.

**Deliverables:**
- A report detailing the selected tool, installation instructions, the specific commands used for conversion, and notes regarding verification of the generated FASTQ files.

**Additional Considerations (Optional):**

- **Automation:** If handling multiple BAM files, consider scripting the conversion process for efficiency.  Languages like Python or Bash are convenient for this purpose.
- **Parameter Optimization:** Some tools may offer parameters to fine-tune the conversion process (e.g., filtering reads based on quality).  If relevant to your data, discuss these options.

### Task 2: Running FastQC
**Objective:** Evaluate the quality of raw sequencing data.

#### Instructions:

1. **FastQC Installation:**
   - Install FastQC (version X.X.X, if applicable) on your local machine or server. Provide a summary of the installation process, including any commands used.

2. **Quality Assessment:**
   - Run FastQC on your Illumina (in .fastq or .fastq.gz format) and PacBio HiFi (in .fastq or .fastq.gz format) raw data files. Document the commands used. Include a brief discussion of the significance of key quality metrics reported by FastQC.

3. **Results Interpretation:**
   - Analyze the FastQC reports and save them in a designated output directory. Highlight any concerns or areas where the data quality may impact downstream analyses. Discuss the implications of these findings for genome assembly. Note that tools tailored to long-reads might provide additional insights into PacBio HiFi-specific quality metrics.

### Task 4: Technical Adapter Trimming for Illumina Data

**Objective:** Remove technical adapters from Illumina sequencing data to improve the quality and accuracy of downstream analyses.

#### Instructions:

1. **Trimming Software Selection:**
   - Select a suitable adapter trimming tool. Popular choices include:
      - **Trimmomatic:** Versatile and user-friendly ([http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic))
      - **Cutadapt:** Flexible and supports various adapter types ([https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
      - **fastp:** A fast and all-in-one preprocessor that includes trimming ([https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp))
      - **V2trim:** A fast and parallel implementation of Trimmomatic ([https://github.com/aglabx/v2trim](https://github.com/aglabx/v2trim)). We usually use it.
   - Install your chosen tool, providing a summary of the installation process.

2. **Identifying Adapter Sequences:**
   -  Determine the technical adapter sequences used in your Illumina sequencing data.
     -  If unknown, refer to the sequencing facility's documentation or consult resources for standard Illumina adapters.
     -  If needed, overrepresented sequences identified in the initial FastQC reports may provide clues.

3. **Adapter Trimming:**
   - Execute the chosen trimming tool, providing the following:
      - Input (your raw Illumina reads in FASTQ format)
      - Output (specify file names for the trimmed reads)
      - Adapter sequences (provide them either directly or in a FASTA file)
      - Other relevant parameters (consult the tool's documentation for guidance on quality trimming, minimum read length, etc.)
   - Document the exact command used.  

4. **Trimming Efficiency Evaluation:**
   - Rerun FastQC on the trimmed reads. 
   - Compare the FastQC reports before and after trimming, focusing on:
      - Improvements in the "Per base sequence quality" module 
      - Changes in the "Overrepresented sequences" module

#### Deliverables:
- A report including:
    - Tool selection and installation instructions
    - Identification of adapter sequences
    - The full command used for adapter trimming
    - A discussion of the observed improvements in the FastQC reports after trimming

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Stringency Levels:** Trimming tools often have parameters controlling the strictness of adapter matching.  If unsure, start with default settings and adjust if needed.
- **Paired-End Data:**  Ensure your command correctly handles paired-end Illumina data (reads in two separate files).

### Task 5: Removing Inner Adapters and Concatemers for PacBio HiFi Data

**Objective:** Clean PacBio HiFi data by removing inner adapters and concatemers to optimize downstream assembly.

#### Instructions:

1. **Software Selection and Installation:**
   - **lima:** Specifically designed for demultiplexing and removing SMRTbell adapters from PacBio reads ([https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/barcoding](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/barcoding)).
   - **pbccs:** Generates high-quality consensus sequences (CCS, aka HiFi reads) used for downstream analysis ([https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs)).
   - Please, google for more tools, may be there are more.
   - Provide detailed installation instructions for these tools. Yes, try different for this task.

2. **Adapter Removal with lima:**
   - Run `lima` on your raw PacBio HiFi data (likely in BAM format) to identify and remove SMRTbell adapters. 
   - Specify:
      - Input BAM file
      - Barcode file (if your data is barcoded) 
      - Output file name for demultiplexed and adapter-trimmed reads. 
   - Document the exact `lima` command used.

3. **Consensus Generation with pbccs:**
    - If not already in BAM format, convert your adapter-trimmed output from `lima` into BAM format (tools like `samtools` can assist).
    - Run `pbccs` on the BAM file containing the adapter-trimmed PacBio data to generate high-quality HiFi consensus sequences.
    - Document the specific `pbccs` command and parameters used.

4. **Some new tools:**
   - The same steps.

4. **Data Quality Reassessment**
   - Consider these methods to evaluate the quality of the processed HiFi reads:
      - **Basic Statistics:**  Calculate N50, average read length, and total yield using tools within the PacBio software suite or general-purpose tools like `samtools`.
      - **Re-running FastQC:** Check if any quality issues flagged in the initial FastQC report have been addressed.  
   - Summarize the observed improvements in data quality.

#### Deliverables:
- A detailed report including:
    - Installation instructions for `lima` and `pbccs`
    - Exact commands used for `lima` and `pbccs`
    - Summary of data quality metrics (N50, read length, etc.) before and after cleaning
    - Any relevant FastQC output 

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Visualization:** Explore tools specifically developed for visualizing long reads (e.g., IGV - Integrative Genomics Viewer) to inspect processed HiFi reads. This can highlight remaining artifacts or quality concerns.
