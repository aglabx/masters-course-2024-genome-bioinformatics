**Course Code:** [Insert Course Code]

**Instructor:** [Aleksey Komissarov]

**Submission Date:** [Insert Due Date]

#### Objective:
To gain hands-on experience in de novo gene annotation using a previously masked genome from Homework 1. You will learn to use and train gene prediction tools, interpret the results, and understand the significance of these methods in identifying gene structures in novel genomes.

#### Instructions:
Complete the tasks outlined below and submit a detailed report of your process, findings, and any challenges you encountered. Provide evidence of your work through screenshots, command-line logs, and comprehensive explanations.

### Task 1: De Novo Gene Prediction
**Objective:** Run a de novo gene prediction on the masked genome using a selected tool.

#### Instructions:

1. **Prediction Tool Setup:**
   - Choose a de novo gene prediction tool (e.g., AUGUSTUS, GeneMark-ES, or SNAP).
   - Document the process of installing and setting up the tool for use.

2. **Running the Prediction:**
   - Execute the gene prediction tool on your masked genome from Homework 1.
   - Record all commands used, parameters set, and the rationale behind your choices.

3. **Results Analysis:**
   - Analyze the output of your gene prediction. How many genes were predicted? What are their average lengths?
   - Discuss any issues or uncertainties encountered during the prediction process.

#### Deliverables:
- Detailed documentation of the gene prediction process, including installation, execution, and analysis.

### Task 2: Training AUGUSTUS
**Objective:** Train AUGUSTUS with a known dataset to improve the accuracy of gene predictions on your genome.

#### Instructions:

1. **Understanding Model Training:**
   - Provide a brief overview of how AUGUSTUS can be trained with known gene sets to improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Training Process:**
   - Select a suitable training set (possibly from a closely related species or well-annotated genes within the same species).
   - Document the process of training AUGUSTUS with this set, including any pre-processing of data.

3. **Running the Trained Model:**
   - Use your newly trained AUGUSTUS model to predict genes on the masked genome.
   - Compare the results with the initial predictions. Are there any improvements or differences?

#### Deliverables:
- A comprehensive report on the training process, the execution of the trained model, and an analysis comparing the pre- and post-training results.

### Task 3: Functional Annotation of Predicted Genes
**Objective:** Annotate the predicted genes to understand their potential functions and significance.

#### Instructions:

1. **Annotation Tools:**
   - Select tools for functional annotation (e.g., BLAST against known protein databases, InterProScan for domain identification).

2. **Running Annotations:**
   - Perform functional annotation on your predicted genes.
   - Document each step, tool used, and parameters set.

3. **Interpreting Results:**
   - Analyze the annotation results. Discuss the types of genes, functions, and domains identified.
   - Reflect on the importance of these findings in the context of your genome's biology and potential research applications.

#### Deliverables:
- Detailed documentation and analysis of the functional annotation process and results.

### Task 4: Comparative Analysis and Visualization
**Objective:** Compare your annotated genome with other annotated genomes and visualize the gene structures.

#### Instructions:

1. **Comparison Selection:**
   - Choose one or more annotated genomes for comparison (preferably related species or well-studied organisms).

2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Use tools like JBrowse or the UCSC Genome Browser to compare gene structures and annotations.
   - Discuss any significant similarities or differences found.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create visual representations of gene predictions and annotations using your selected tools.
   - Include screenshots or files of your visualizations in the submission.

#### Deliverables:
- A report on your comparative analysis and visualization process, including interpretations and any interesting findings.

---

### Submission Guidelines:
- Compile your reports, scripts, visualizations, and any additional notes or screenshots into a single, organized submission.
- Label each section clearly with detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions.
- Ensure clarity and accuracy in your documentation. Your work should enable someone else to replicate the process without prior knowledge of these platforms.

**Good luck, and delve deep into the world of de novo gene annotation!**
