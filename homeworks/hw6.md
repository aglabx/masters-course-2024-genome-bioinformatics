### Task 2: Iso-Seq Data Processing and Quality Control
**Objective:** Process the raw Iso-Seq data to prepare it for downstream analysis.

#### Instructions:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Process the data using appropriate tools and document the steps.
2. **Quality Control:**
   - Assess the quality of your processed reads and discuss the metrics.

#### Deliverables:
- Detailed documentation of the data preprocessing and quality control steps.

### Task 3: Transcript Clustering and Polishing
**Objective:** Cluster and refine the processed reads to produce high-quality, full-length transcript isoforms.

#### Instructions:
1. **Clustering:**
   - Group processed reads into transcript clusters representing unique isoforms.
2. **Polishing:**
   - Polish the clustered isoforms to improve accuracy.

#### Deliverables:
- A comprehensive report on the clustering and polishing steps.

### Task 4: Isoform Annotation and Comparative Analysis
**Objective:** Annotate the identified isoforms and perform a comparative analysis to understand their functions and evolution.

#### Instructions:
1. **Isoform Annotation:**
   - Annotate the polished isoforms using databases and tools to infer their functions.
2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare your annotated isoforms with those from other species or previously published annotations.

#### Deliverables:
- Detailed documentation and analysis of the annotation and comparative analysis processes.

### Task 5: Protein Prediction and Annotation from Iso-Seq Data
**Objective:** Predict and annotate proteins from the full-length transcript isoforms identified from Iso-Seq data.

#### Instructions:
1. **Protein Prediction:**
   - Predict the coding sequences (CDS) from the identified isoforms.
2. **Quality Assessment:**
   - Assess the quality of the predicted proteins using suitable tools.
3. **Functional Annotation:**
   - Annotate the predicted proteins using databases to provide insights into their potential functions.
4. **Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (Optional):**
   - Predict potential protein-protein interactions and discuss their implications.

#### Deliverables:
- A comprehensive report documenting the protein prediction process, quality assessment, functional annotation, and any protein-protein interaction predictions.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Compile your reports, scripts, visualizations, and any additional notes or screenshots into a single, organized submission.
- Label each section clearly with detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions.
- Ensure clarity and accuracy in your documentation. Your work should enable someone else to replicate the process without prior knowledge of these platforms.

**Good luck, and immerse yourself in the complex world of transcriptomics and proteomics with Iso-Seq analysis!**
