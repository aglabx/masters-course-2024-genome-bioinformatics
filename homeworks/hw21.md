      - Specifying the operating system
      - Addressing dependencies (e.g., zlib) 
      - Compilation commands (if needed)
      - Remember about software's version, one software but different versions sometime return a very differnt results

2. **Running Hifiasm:**
   - Execute Hifiasm to assemble your preprocessed PacBio HiFi reads:
      - Provide the exact command syntax, highlighting:
         - Input (cleaned HiFi FASTQ or BAM)
         - Specify the output prefix for assembly files
         - Threads for parallelization (adjust based on available compute resources)
         - Consider advanced parameters for fine-tuning if relevant (explore Hifiasm's documentation)

3. **Assembly Quality Assessment:**
   - **Metrics:** Use standard assembly metrics:
      - **QUAST:** Assess contiguity, completeness, potential misassemblies ([https://github.com/ablab/quast](https://github.com/ablab/quast) )
      - **BUSCO:** Evaluate gene content completeness ([https://busco.ezlab.org/](https://busco.ezlab.org/))
   - **Contextualization:** 
       -  Compare the Hifiasm assembly to:
           - Expected genome size and complexity
           -  Results from other assemblers, if available 

4. **Critical Evaluation:**
   - Based on the quality metrics and comparative analysis:
      - Highlight the advantages of Hifiasm's approach for HiFi data (e.g., accuracy, resolving repetitive regions).
