**Submission Date:** April 4, 2024

**File location:** https://github.com/aglabx/masters-course-2024-genome-bioinformatics/blob/main/homeworks/hw3_2024.md

#### Objective:
This assignment aims to provide you with practical experience in gene annotation processes, combining ab initio prediction, homology-based approaches, and transcript evidence. By completing this assignment, you will learn how to:

- Predict genes in a genome using AUGUSTUS and GeneMark.

### Task 1: Gene Prediction (5 points)

**Objective:** Use AUGUSTUS and GeneMark for ab initio gene prediction in the provided genome sequence.

#### Instructions:

**AUGUSTUS:**

1. Install AUGUSTUS using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda augustus
   ```
2. Run AUGUSTUS on the provided genome:
   ```bash
   augustus --species=your_species <genome_file.fasta> > augustus_output.gff3
   ```
   Replace `your_species` with the appropriate model organism.

**GeneMark:**

1. Follow the installation instructions provided on the GeneMark website.
2. Run GeneMark on the genome:
   ```bash
   gms2.pl --seq <genome_file.fasta> --genome-type auto --output genemark_output.gff3
   ```

#### Deliverables:
- The report should include the commands used for installation and running each prediction tool.
- Include a summary of the predicted gene numbers from each tool.

### Task 2: Homology-Based Annotation (4 points)

**Objective:** Use Exonerate and MMSeqs2 to align proteins from a closely related species to the genome.

#### Instructions:

**Exonerate with Proteins:**

1. Install Exonerate using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda exonerate
   ```
2. Align proteins to the genome:
   ```bash
   exonerate --model protein2genome --showtargetgff true <protein_sequences.fasta> <genome_file.fasta> > exonerate_output.gff3
   ```

**MMSeqs2 with Proteins:**

1. Install MMSeqs2 using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda mmseqs2
   ```
2. Create a database for the protein sequences and the genome, and then run the search:
   ```bash
   mmseqs createdb <protein_sequences.fasta> proteinsDB
   mmseqs createdb <genome_file.fasta> genomeDB
   mmseqs search proteinsDB genomeDB resultDB tmp
   mmseqs convertalis proteinsDB genomeDB resultDB result.m8
   ```

#### Deliverables:
- The report should detail the installation and command steps for Exonerate and MMSeqs2.
- Include a discussion on the significance of the protein alignments in gene annotation.

### Task 3: RNA-seq Mapping (3 points)

**Objective:** Map RNA-seq data to the genome to provide transcript evidence for gene annotation.

#### Instructions:

1. Install HISAT2, a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda hisat2
   ```
2. Build an index for your genome:
   ```bash
   hisat2-build <genome_file.fasta> genome_index
   ```
3. Map RNA-seq reads to the genome:
   ```bash
   hisat2 -x genome_index -U <reads_file.fastq> -S mapped_reads.sam
   ```

#### Deliverables:
- Include commands for index building and RNA-seq mapping.
- Discuss how RNA-seq evidence supports gene annotation.

Certainly, we can adjust Task 4 to focus on comparing the intersection between intervals of RefSeq GFF and our resulting GFF. The detailed instructions from a specific Colab notebook can guide this task. Let's modify Task 4 accordingly:

### Task 4: Comparing Annotations with RefSeq GFF (3 points)

**Objective:** Validate and refine your gene annotations by comparing the intersection of intervals between your annotation results and RefSeq GFF data.

#### Instructions:

This task requires you to compare your annotated genes (in GFF format) with the RefSeq GFF file for your organism of interest. The goal is to understand how well your annotations match up with the RefSeq annotations, which serves as a standard reference.

1. **Preparation:**

   First, ensure you have both your GFF file from the previous tasks (e.g., `predicted_genes.gff3`) and the RefSeq GFF file for the relevant organism. If you do not have the RefSeq GFF file, you can download it from the NCBI website.

2. **Bedtools Installation:**

   Install Bedtools, a powerful tool for genome arithmetic, which you will use to compare GFF files:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda bedtools
   ```

3. **Intersecting GFF Files:**

   Use Bedtools to find overlaps between your GFF file and the RefSeq GFF file. This step will help identify matching annotations, partial overlaps, and unique annotations in both files.
   ```bash
   bedtools intersect -a predicted_genes.gff3 -b refseq_genes.gff3 -wa -wb > intersection_results.txt
   ```

4. **Analysis:**

   - Open the resulting `intersection_results.txt` file.
   - Analyze the intersections to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of your annotations compared to RefSeq.
   - Identify and document cases of exact match, partial overlap, and unique annotations in your report.

#### Deliverables:

- The report should include the command used for intersecting GFF files.
- A summary of the intersection analysis:
  - The number of exact matches, partial overlaps, and unique annotations.
  - Discussion on the significance of these results for the quality of your annotation.

#### Additional Notes:

For detailed instructions and examples on how to perform these tasks, see **Genes annotation part 1 colab**. This Colab notebook provides step-by-step guidance on handling GFF files, executing intersection operations, and analyzing the results effectively. Make sure to adapt the instructions from the Colab to fit the specific details of your assignment, such as file paths and organism names.

**Note to remember:**

As you work through this task, consider the implications of the intersections for your annotations' accuracy and completeness. Document any discrepancies between your annotations and the RefSeq data, as these can highlight areas for further investigation or refinement in your gene prediction methods.

**Good luck with your comparative analysis, and may it enrich your understanding of gene annotation accuracy and reliability!**
