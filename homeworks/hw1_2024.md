### Submission Guidelines:
- Compile your answers, screenshots, and any additional notes into a single document.
- Label each section clearly and provide thoughtful, detailed responses.
- Check for clarity and accuracy before submitting.

### Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Always use separate environments for software installation and testing. Use conda create / activate to create and activate a new environment for each complex software installation. Deactivate the environment when you are done. Don't install software in your base environment except for very simple tools.
- Contral remaining disk space on your server. Use the `df -h` command to check the remaining disk space on your server. If you are running out of disk space, delete unnecessary files or move them to a different location.
- Don't use the home directory for storing your data.
- Back up your data/code regularly. Use the `rsync` command to back up your data to a different location.
- Don't use the root directory for chaotically storing your data. Use folders and subfolders to organize your data. For example, create a folder called `data` and then create subfolders for each task. Or create a folder for each task and then create subfolders for each dataset. And be consistent with your naming/structure conventions.
- Good practice to check the size of your data before downloading it. Use the `du -sh` command to check the size of your data.
- You can check file contents using the `head` and `tail` commands. For example, `head -n 10 file.txt` will print the first 10 lines of the file. `tail -n 10 file.txt` will print the last 10 lines of the file. Sometimes it will save a lot of time with some strange errors when it was wrong file or wrong format.
- Remember about --threads and --pa flags, don't run heavy tasks with only one thread.
- Please use Screen / tmux and similar for running processes in the background, don't use nohup.
- Please download genome as one file, don't use individual
