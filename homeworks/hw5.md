**Course Code:** [Insert Course Code]

**Instructor:** [Aleksey Komissarov]

**Submission Date:** [Insert Due Date]

#### Objective:
To learn how to utilize transcriptomic and proteomic data to enhance the quality and accuracy of genome annotations. You will use evidence from the same species or closely related species to improve your annotations from Homework 4 and compare the results to understand the impact of incorporating multi-omic data.

#### Instructions:
Complete the tasks outlined below and submit a detailed report of your process, findings, and any challenges you encountered. Provide evidence of your work through screenshots, command-line logs, and comprehensive explanations.

### Task 1: Collecting Transcriptomic and Proteomic Data
**Objective:** Obtain and preprocess transcriptomic and proteomic data relevant to your species of interest.

#### Instructions:

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Identify sources for transcriptomic and proteomic data for your chosen species or a close relative.
   - Document the process of obtaining this data, noting any challenges or important considerations.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the transcriptomic and proteomic data to prepare it for annotation improvement.

#### Deliverables:
- A report on the data acquisition and preprocessing steps, including sources, methods, and any initial observations.

### Task 2: Enhancing Annotations with Transcriptomic Data
**Objective:** Use transcriptomic evidence to improve the gene models predicted in your genome.

#### Instructions:

1. **Alignment of Transcripts:**
   - Align the transcriptomic data to your genome using tools like GMAP or BLAT.
   - Document your choice of tool, parameters, and the alignment process.

2. **Incorporating Evidence:**
   - Use the aligned transcripts to improve your gene predictions. Tools such as EvidenceModeler can be helpful here.
   - Record the steps, commands, and parameters used.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Compare the new annotations with your previous predictions. Note any changes in gene number, structure, or other features.

#### Deliverables:
- Detailed documentation of the process and tools used to enhance annotations with transcriptomic data, along with a comparative analysis of the results.

### Task 3: Refining Annotations with Proteomic Data
**Objective:** Use proteomic evidence to further refine and validate your gene annotations.

#### Instructions:

1. **Protein Alignment:**
   - Align the proteomic data to your annotated genome using tools like Exonerate or BLASTX.
   - Document your choice of tool, parameters used, and the alignment process.

2. **Annotation Improvement:**
   - Integrate the proteomic evidence into your annotations, adjusting gene models where necessary.
   - Record the steps and tools used in this process.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Compare the refined annotations with both the original and transcriptome-enhanced annotations. Discuss the impact of proteomic evidence on the quality and accuracy of your annotations.

#### Deliverables:
- A comprehensive report on the use of proteomic data to refine annotations, including methodological details and a comparative analysis of the annotations.

### Task 4: Comparative and Functional Analysis
**Objective:** Conduct a comparative and functional analysis of the improved annotations to understand the biological implications.

#### Instructions:

1. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare your final, improved annotations with those from other species or previously published annotations for the same species. Use tools like JBrowse or UCSC Genome Browser for visualization.

2. **Functional Analysis:**
   - Use tools such as InterProScan, GO term enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis to understand the functional implications of your annotated genes.

3. **Reflection:**
   - Reflect on the importance of transcriptomic and proteomic data in genome annotation. Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered and how they might be addressed in future studies.

#### Deliverables:
- A detailed report of your comparative and functional analysis, including visualizations, key findings, and a reflective discussion on the importance of multi-omic evidence in genome annotation.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Compile your reports, scripts, visualizations, and any additional notes or screenshots into a single, organized submission.
- Label each section clearly with detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions.
- Ensure clarity and accuracy in your documentation. Your work should enable someone else to replicate the process without prior knowledge of these platforms.

**Good luck, and explore the depth of genome annotation with multi-omic integration!**
